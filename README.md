About me
======

My name is Henning. Most people just call me `Hen` or `de henne`. You can do that too :wink:
I like to build products, startups, services, or e-commerce shops. Therefore I am also co-founder of some companies and services.

❤️ QUIQQER
------

[QUIQQER](https://www.quiqqer.com) is the all-around carefree Enterprise Content Management System. I have been developing QUIQQER with my colleague for over 10 years. 

The goal of QUIQQER is to get a SaaS or e-commerce shop up and running in minutes and go for it.
Whether it is an invoicing system, an ordering system, a merchandise management system, a membership system, an e-commerce shop, or a simple website, with QUIQQER this is now possible.

Since I am a strong believer in the open-source idea, the basic system of QUIQQER is free and open source.
